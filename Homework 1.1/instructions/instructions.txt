Movies
You work for Paramount Pictures. Your boss has just acquired data about how much audiences and critics like movies as well as other variables. She is interested in learning what attributes make a movie popular. She wants your team to figure it all out.

The data set is comprised of 651 randomly sampled movies produced and released before 2106. Note that some of the variables are only there for informational purposes and it might not be the best idea to consider them in your analysis. For example, actor 1 through actor 5 variables were used to determined whether the movie casts an actor or actress who won a best actor or actress Oscar.

Research Questions
These are some of the research questions that might lead your analysis. You might as well come up with other interesting ones. Based on this data set:
1. What can we say about the relationship between audience scores and at least four of the other variables in this dataset?
2. Is there a difference in the score given by audience members (or critics) for movies of different genres? And for movies with different MPAA ratings? If so, which categories seem to be significantly different for each other?
