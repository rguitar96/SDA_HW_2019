1-is there a relationship between the type/genre and score?
2-comparing different scores (critics/audience/imdb)
	-is there any difference on the audience/critics score by genre?
3-comparison best picture/oscar wins and score/oscar wins
	-are oscar-awarded films more liked?
4-what are the trends over the years?
	-preferred month for releases? number of films by month (over the years? does it affect the score?)
	-does the genre change over the years?
	-do older films tend to have higher score/number of votes? if this is true, it could be because only good old films get remembered
5-do actors and directors have a higher score once they won? (find the first film and see the tendency, look for sudden change)

-at which population size can we consider a score? do score change depending on the population size of the film? maybe rerun with and without removing them
